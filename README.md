One of my favorite hobbies is traveling to a place that I have never been to and learning about the people, culture, and history of that place. I love traveling because it allows me to gain a deeper understanding of myself and of the world around me. [Hello World](https://kapham2.github.io/hello-world-app-frontend/) is a web application that inspires travel and connects like-minded people around the world.
